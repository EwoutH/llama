## Phylogenies

The nearest neighbours of each of the query sequences are shown below to enable the assessment of monophyly.







Tree number 1 contains 5 queries.

## Tree background

The following plots describe the location of the sequences in the collapsed nodes.
If more than one country was present, the bar chart describes the number of sequences present in each country. 
Where there were 10 countries or more, the largest 10 have been taken.
